# Password Generator

Utilized four specifically ranged random number generators tied to specific user input conditions (Use numbers, lowercase, uppercase, etc) to generate ASCII code in an array, then converted said array to a single string for a given password length also determined by user input.

- Specific comments regarding the functionality of each block/function can be found within the file script.js

- No reload is needed to generate a new password, a simple click of the appropriately labeled "Generate Password" will reset the userPreferences allowing a user to create multiple distinct passwords. 

- There may be a settings.json file in the git repo, however I believe this is just an artifact from the live server extension in VScode and serves no practical function to the webpage

- Page is deployed to https://atlas238.github.io/password-generator/
